# E-commerce-churn-analysis-and-prediction
.This project analyzed customer churn in an e-commerce setting to understand patterns, identify high-risk customers, 
and recommend strategies to retain them. 
The analysis and predictive modeling revealed key insights about customer behavior and factors contributing to churn. 
By segmenting customers based on churn risk, we identified groups requiring different retention strategies. 
High-risk segments included inactive users and those with a pattern of recent but low-value purchases. 
  
Lower-risk segments were often repeat buyers and those with higher engagement levels. 
The machine learning model, such as a Random Forest Classifier, achieved high accuracy in identifying customers likely 
to churn.
